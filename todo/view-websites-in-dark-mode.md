# View Websites in Dark Mode

The first thing you'll need in order to view websites in dark mode on Safari is [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app). It is a macOS app which dynamically re-renders websites without a built-in dark mode using custom CSS rules. You can discover community-curated custom CSS rules from various sources including GitHub & [Stylish](https://userstyles.org).

## GitHub

You can view GitHub in Dark Mode using [GitHub-Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark). You can even adapt it to work with a GitHub Enterprise distribution if you change the regex in the rules from "github.com" to "github.*enterprise*.com".

You can customize the style further with variables:

* GitHub syntax theme: One Dark
* CodeMirror syntax theme: One Dark
* Code Tab size: 2
* Code Font: ui-monospace (to use the system monospace font)
* Code Wrap: Wrap
