      <p>Whether you&#39;re preparing marketing materials for a new app or assembling a Keynote presentation to show off an app&#39;s features, you will certainly want to present your app in the best light possible. A professional touch can be achieved by embedding screenshots of your app in Apple&#39;s official product images. Apple provides <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#section-products">marketing images</a> for all its products, including combinations in case your app crosses multiple platforms. You can leverage these as well as the other assets on Apple&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines">Marketing Resources and Identity Guidelines</a> page to demonstrate a higher level of quality to your audience.</p>
      <p>One process you can employ to embed screenshots in Apple product images involves using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104">Pixelmator</a>. Since Apple distributes its product images as .psd files and you may be hesitant to subscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud due to its recurring expense, Pixelmator could serve as a replacement since it can open .psd files directly.</p>
      <p>Begin by taking screenshots of your app (<em>Tip</em>: refer to <a href="CaptureIPhoneScreenshotsWithConsistentTime.html"><em>Capture iPhone Screenshots with Consistent Time</em></a> to enforce a static time across all your screenshots). Then, obtain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#section-products">product images</a> of your device. Take caution to use the <strong>exact</strong> model on which you captured the screenshot so the image fits neatly without any scaling in the template.</p>
      <p>Once you have the screenshot on your Mac and the product image opened with Pixelmator, open Pixelmator&#39;s layers panel via View &gt; Show Layers (⌘2). Now, follow these steps for each screenshot you want to frame:
      1. Drag the screenshot to the top of the layers list.
      2. Right-click (⌃-click) the screenshot&#39;s layer to reveal a menu.
      3. Choose Create Clipping Mask.
      4. Drag the corners of the screenshot to the edges of the frame until the edges snap to the guides.
      5. In the top-right of the window, choose OK.</p>
      <p>You should now have a perfectly-framed screenshot of your app. To obtain an image file you can use in other apps:
      1. Save the file&#39;s contents to an image via File &gt; Save... (⌘S).
      2. Select the directory to which the image should be saved.
      3. Select the checkbox before Save copy as.
      4. Select HEIF (or whichever format fits your needs best; HEIF is a good choice since it minimizes file size, though).
      5. Drag the slider to your desired level of quality.
      6. Choose Save.</p>
      <p>Now, you can use that photo in other apps like Keynote.</p>
