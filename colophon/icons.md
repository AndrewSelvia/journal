# Icons

## Main

The main icon is a stylized "S". Imagine pulling each end of an "S" outward. The "S" pays homage to the primary author's last name: Selvia. The icon itself pays homage to the leaf of the Apple icon. In fact, it was created by obtaining an Apple icon from [official marketing material](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/marketing), extracting just the leaf, splitting it diagonally, and transposing the rightmost half down and to the left until the points of each half of the leaf connected.

## Sidebar

The sidebar icon was created by the process described in [*Get SF Symbols in SVG Format*](/todo/get-sf-symbols-in-svg-format.md).

## GitHub

The GitHub icon was obtained directly from [GitHub's marketing materials](https://github.com/logos).
