# Non-Python Tooling

It's reasonable to be excited by machine learning but harbor some resistance toward its heavily Python-based tooling. Luckily, some alternatives exist. This document collects some of those options.

## Scala

* [TensorFlow Scala](http://platanios.org/tensorflow_scala/)
* [Machine Learning with Scala in Google Colaboratory](https://medium.com/@shadaj/machine-learning-with-scala-in-google-colaboratory-e6f1661f1c88)
  
## Swift

* [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift)
* [Swift for TensorFlow Deep Learning Library](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis)
