# TeXiFy-IDEA

If you are accustomed to writing code in a JetBrains IDE like IntelliJ IDEA and would like to utilize the same editor for writing LaTeX documents, you should take advantage of [TeXiFy-IDEA](https://github.com/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA). This plugin provides syntax highlighting and other deep integrations into the LaTeX ecosystem. Importantly, you can continue to leverage your experience with JetBrains IDEs (i.e. keyboard shortcuts, appearance, etc.).

TeXiFy-IDEA also supports [BibTeX](https://github.com/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA/wiki/Features#bibtex). For usage details, refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA/wiki/BibTeX). One word of advice if you're just adding a BibTeX bibliography to an existing document you've been compiling already with TeXiFy-IDEA in IntelliJ IDEA: wipe out the existing Run Configuration, then select the **Run**/**Play** button in the gutter of the main tex file to create the necessary Run Configurations now that your project uses BibTeX. TeXiFy-IDEA knows how to automatically create the 4 Run Configurations required to make this workflow work properly.
