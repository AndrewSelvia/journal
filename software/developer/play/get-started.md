# Get Started

[Play](https://www.playframework.com) is a web framework with deep roots in the Scala ecosystem. It is built to be fast by leveraging Akka at its foundation. To get started, refer to [*Getting Started with Play Framework*](https://www.playframework.com/getting-started), the [documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/Home), and the [tutorials](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/Tutorials). Once you're ready to begin coding, you should start with a template project like [play-scala-seed.g8](https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-seed.g8).
